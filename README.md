# Digit-Recognizer
Digit Recognizer Machine Learning and Deep Learning
The goal of the project is recognizing the handwritten digits with high accuracy. This was implemented using ML and DL. The outliers were found using the Mahalanobis distance, the data is then normalized and the feature ranking and selection is done using Fisherâ€™s LDR. K-fold cross validation is used for data splitting and validation. The ML techniques used are Gaussian Bayes Classifier and  Support Vector Machine. CNN using Keras and Tensorflow is used  as a Deep Learning technique. 
Digit Recognizer ML and DL .ipnb is the notebook explaining the approach for different data processing, ML and DL in detail.
